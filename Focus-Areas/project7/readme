Goal of the Project: To find the co-relation between the activity and the stress
for the students studying in a university, along with the other stress correlated
features and training a classifier model to classify the mental state of a student.

Main Result of the Project: We were able to find the co relation between the
stress and activity for the students U10 and U16, and later derived a negative
corelation between stress and conversation.
