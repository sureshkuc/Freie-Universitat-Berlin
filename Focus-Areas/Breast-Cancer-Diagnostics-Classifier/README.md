# Breast Cancer Diagnostics Classifier

This project aims to develop and evaluate the best possible classifier for diagnosing breast cancer based on various features, and also identifies the most important features for proper classification.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build, evaluate, and analyze the most effective classifier for breast cancer diagnosis. The key features of the dataset are used to train different classifiers, and the best performing model is selected.

The project focuses on:
- Evaluating multiple classification algorithms.
- Comparing Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost Ensemble, and Logistic Regression.
- Identifying key features for accurate classification.

### Main Result
The **Random Forest classifier** achieved an accuracy of about **97%** in predicting breast cancer diagnosis.

### Personal Key Learnings
- Built four classifiers for the first time: **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **XGBoost Ensemble**, and **Random Forest Classifiers**.
- Learned how to select important features to improve classifier performance.

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sureshkuc/breast-cancer-diagnostics.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the dataset:

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### 1. Train the Model and Generate Results:

Run the `main.py` script to train the classifiers and generate output files:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will train all classifiers, evaluate them, and generate:
- **Confusion matrices** (`cm1.png`, `cm2.png`).
- **ROC curve** (`roc.png`).
- **Evaluation metrics** for each classifier in the output.

### 2. View Evaluation Results:

After training, you can find evaluation results in the **`outputs/`** folder. The evaluation includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
