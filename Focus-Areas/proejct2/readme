Goal of the Project: To build, and eventually evaluate and analyze the best
possible classifier for Breast Cancer Diagnostics, along with which features are
the most important to get the proper classification.

Main Result of the Project: The Random Forest classifier was accurate at
predicting the Breast Cancer evaluation with an accuracy of about 95

Personal Key Leanings: We created four classifiers for the first time
(Regression, Decision Tree, Xgboost Ensemble, Random forest classifiers), and
learnt how to pick the best features.
