# Sparse Hierarchical Graph Classification

In this study, we implement a sparse hierarchical graph classification architecture designed to predict class labels for entire graphs. The main aim of this approach is to reduce memory usage during model training without sacrificing accuracy, especially when compared to prior prominent methods that are not scalable to large graphs.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project focuses on:
- **Reducing Memory Usage**: The proposed method requires only O(V + E) storage complexity, as compared to the quadratic O(kV¬≤) storage complexity required by the state-of-the-art approach (DiffPool1).
- **Maintaining Accuracy**: The method achieves competitive performance, with accuracy within 1% of the state-of-the-art algorithm.
- **Scalability**: The method scales efficiently on large graph datasets, ensuring faster processing and lower memory consumption.

We compare the performance of this architecture against the state-of-the-art DiffPool1 on several graph classification benchmarks.

| Dataset         | No. of Classes | Avg. No. of Nodes | Avg. No. of Edges | Node Attributes (Dim.) |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|

| **D&D**         | 2              | 284.32            | 715.66            | -                      |
| **Collab**      | 3              | 74.49             | 2457.78           | -                      |
