Goal of the Project: To build a Deep Learing algorithm to classify the breast
tumour tissue as Benign (Non - Cancer) or Malignant (Cancer) through breast
cancer histopathology images.

Main Result of the Project: A Deep Learning Based Classifier (CNN) was built
to classify the tumour into cancerous or non cancerous.

Personal Key Leanings: We created a deep learning classifier for the first time,
and understood the vital aspects of the algorithm.
