Goal of the Project: To study the data given, about the students’ personality
traits, social behaviour and predict how co-related ((Or Different) are the
individuals from others in the group along with predicting the individual’s
personality.

Main Result of the Project: We were able to fetch the information of the
students who are highly co-related and highly not-co-related with the others
members of the group, along with creating a classification and regression models
to correctly classify individual traits. We found best classification with logistic
regression model with auc 0.74 with target trait neurotic-ism and best regression
model with mean squared error 0.42 and R2
(coefficient of determination) 0.01
with trait conscientiousness.
