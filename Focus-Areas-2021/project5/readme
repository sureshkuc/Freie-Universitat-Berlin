Goal of the Project: To execute SQL queries using Python programming
language with BigQuery and estimate scan size using helper package, along with
plotting the most meaningful data graphically from a huge chunk of data.

Main Result of the Project: Successfully running the query(s) on Google Colab
using BigQuery API, in a very quick succession of time.

Personal Key Leanings: We understood the Big Query API, how fast it works,
and to use those APIs using Python Notebooks (Google Colab).

Keywords: BigQuery API; SQL; Large Dataset; Quick execution
