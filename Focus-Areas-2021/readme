Project2: To build, and eventually evaluate and analyze the best
possible classifier for Breast Cancer Diagnostics, along with which features are
the most important to get the proper classification.

Project3: To build a Deep Learing algorithm to classify the breast
tumour tissue as Benign (Non - Cancer) or Malignant (Cancer) through breast
cancer histopathology images.

Project4: Task 1 : To gather statistical information about the data along with
preprocessing the data like imputation.
Task 2 : Using spark to develop evaluate and compare two predictors to predict
the probability of a stroke happening to a patient, for both balanced and
unbalanced dataset.

Project5: To execute SQL queries using Python programming
language with BigQuery and estimate scan size using helper package, along with
plotting the most meaningful data graphically from a huge chunk of data.

Project6: We need to forecast numbers of covid-19 cases in Germany
(time-series data) using decomposition model and an auto-regressive model with
visualization and analysis.

Project7 & 8: To find the co-relation between the activity and the stress
for the students studying in a university, along with the other stress correlated
features and training a classifier model to classify the mental state of a student.

Project9: To study the data given, about the students’ personality
traits, social behaviour and predict how co-related ((Or Different) are the
individuals from others in the group along with predicting the individual’s
personality.

Project10: To employ cluster analysis and dimensionality reduction
(using SVD) to extract patterns from large data of Facebook users and their likes
and use the extracted patterns to build models aimed at predicting psychological
outcomes
