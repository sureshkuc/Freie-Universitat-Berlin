Goal of the Project: We need to forecast numbers of covid-19 cases in Germany
(time-series data) using decomposition model and an auto-regressive model with
visualization and analysis.

Main Result of the Project: Successfully build the decomposition
model(Prophet library), an auto-regressive model and LSTM to predict the
number of Covid-19 case in Germany with analysis.

Personal Key Leanings: We understood the vital aspect of decomposition
model(Prophet library), an auto-regressive model(SARIMA) and LSTM to predict
the time series data.

Keywords: Time Series data trend, seasonality and noise; Prophet library;
SARIMA; LSTM; Covid-19 cases in Germany
