Goal of the Project:
Task 1 : To gather statistical information about the data along with
preprocessing the data like imputation.
Task 2 : Using spark to develop evaluate and compare two predictors to predict
the probability of a stroke happening to a patient, for both balanced and
unbalanced dataset.

Main Result of the Project: Data exploration and comparing the accuracy of 2
algorithms for balanced and unbalanced data set using Spark.

Personal Key Leanings: We have done exploratory data analysis and
implemented machine learning models using spark instead of using traditional
techniques.

Keywords: Data Cleaning; Spark; SQL;
