# CIFAR-Type Image Classification

Welcome to the **CIFAR-Type Image Classification** project! 🐱🐶🐸  
This project focuses on training a neural network model to classify images of cats, dogs, and frogs from the CIFAR-like dataset.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

You are given a dataset consisting of **6000 images** of three classes:
- **Cat (0)**
- **Dog (1)**
- **Frog (2)**

The dataset contains:
- **Training images** (x_train) with associated labels (y_train).
- **Test images** (x_test) without labels, which need to be predicted.

Your task is to:
- Train a neural network to classify the images into the three categories.
- Predict the labels for the **test set** (x_test).
- Upload your predictions for the test set.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Contains the CIFAR-type dataset with training and testing images.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the neural network model and training process:
    - **`config.py`**: Configuration file for hyperparameters and settings.
    - **`resnet.py`**: Implementation of the ResNet model.
    - **`train.py`**: Script for training the neural network.
    - **`main.py`**: Main script to run the project and generate predictions.
- **`outputs/`**: Stores results like predictions, model weights, and training logs.

---

## 📋 Files Overview

### `config.py`
- This file contains all the hyperparameters and configurations for the model training process. Modify it to adjust the learning rate, batch size, and other parameters.

### `resnet.py`
- Defines a **ResNet (Residual Network)** architecture tailored for image classification. This architecture is known for its ability to train deeper networks efficiently using residual connections.

### `train.py`
- This script handles the training process, including model compilation, training, and evaluation. It saves the trained model and metrics like accuracy and loss.

### `main.py`
- The main entry point for running the project. It loads the data, configures the model, trains it, and generates predictions on the test set.

## 🛠 Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sureshkuc/cifar-type-image-classification.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the dataset:

Place the CIFAR-like dataset (training and test images) into the `data/` folder. The dataset should be in the form of images with associated labels.

## 🚀 How to Train the Model

### 1. Train the Model:

To train the ResNet model on the CIFAR-type data, run:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

This will train the model and save the weights, training logs, and other results in the `outputs/` folder.

### 2. Generate Predictions:

After training the model, run the following command to generate predictions for the test set:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will output the predicted labels for the test set and save them in the `outputs/` folder.

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

Once the model has been trained, you can evaluate its performance on the test set. The evaluation metrics (such as accuracy and loss) will be saved in the `outputs/` folder. You can also plot the training error convergence to visualize how the model improved during training.
