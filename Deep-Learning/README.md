# Deep Learning Challenges: Image Classification, Time Series, and Sequence Prediction

Welcome to the **Deep Learning Challenges** project! This repository contains several challenges related to image classification, time-series dimension reduction, and sequence prediction using neural networks. Each folder contains a separate challenge with corresponding datasets and model implementations.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository includes four main challenges:

1. **MNIST-Type Prediction Challenge**  
   Predict handwritten digits from MNIST-like image data using neural networks.
   
2. **CIFAR-Type Prediction Challenge**  
   Classify images of cats, dogs, and frogs using a neural network model.

3. **Time Series Dimension Reduction Challenge**  
   Reduce the dimensionality of a time series to disentangle metastable states.

4. **RNN and LSTM Sequence Classification Challenge**  
   Classify genetic sequences into categories using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is organized into four folders, each corresponding to one challenge:

- **`cifar-image-class-prediction/`**: CIFAR image classification using CNNs.
- **`genetic-sequence-classification/`**: Genetic sequence classification using RNNs and LSTMs.
- **`mnist-digit-prediction/`**: MNIST-like image classification using fully connected networks or CNNs.
- **`time-series-dimension-reduction/`**: Time series data dimension reduction using Autoencoders.

## üìã Challenges Overview

### 1. **MNIST-Type Prediction Challenge**  
   - **Goal**: Train a neural network model to predict the digits (0-9) from the MNIST-like dataset.
   - **Data**: The dataset consists of training images with labels and an unlabeled test set.
   - **Model**: You are free to experiment with different neural network architectures, including Fully Connected Networks (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
   
### 2. **CIFAR-Type Prediction Challenge**  
   - **Goal**: Classify images of cats, dogs, and frogs.
   - **Data**: The dataset contains 6000 images, each labeled as a cat (0), dog (1), or frog (2).
   - **Task**: Predict the labels for an unlabeled test set.
   - **Presentation**: Be prepared to explain how you chose the network architecture, hyperparameters, data preparation, and model validation.

### 3. **Time Series Dimension Reduction Challenge**  
   - **Goal**: Perform dimensionality reduction on a 3D time-series dataset and separate four metastable states.
   - **Data**: The dataset consists of time-series data with 100,000 data points and three dimensions (T√ó3).
   - **Task**: 
     1. Use an autoencoder or other methods to reduce the dimensionality and separate the states.
     2. Discretize the data into four labels representing the metastable states.
     3. Validate the model using a separate validation set with corresponding labels.
   
### 4. **RNN and LSTM Sequence Classification Challenge**  
   - **Goal**: Train a model to classify genetic sequences into five categories using RNNs or LSTMs.
   - **Data**: 
     - 400 labeled sequences of 400 characters each.
     - 100 validation sequences of 1200 characters each.
     - 250 unlabeled sequences of 2000 characters.
   - **Hint**: RNN training can be resource-intensive, so plan accordingly to complete the challenge on time.
