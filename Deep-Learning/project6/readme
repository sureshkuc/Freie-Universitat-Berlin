You are given a three-dimensional time series data: data_x∈R^T×3, with T=100,000 (number of data points). The data points in this time series can be grouped/clustered into four (metastable) states which, unfortunately, cannot be separated by simple geometric means.

Your first task is to perform a dimension reduction from the original three-dimensional representation into a one-dimensional time series in such a way that the four different states become disentangled. In other words, the four states must be easily separable in the one-dimensional representation. We recommend to use a time-lagged autoencoder for this task, but your are free to try other approaches, too.

Hint: a proper data whitening might be very beneficial for the training.

In the second task, you have to discretize your one-dimensional representation, i.e., all data points which seem to belong to the same (metastable) state must be assigned the same label data_y∈{0,1,2,3}. The order in which you label the metastable states is not important (we will test all combinations).

Hint: you can do the discretization, e.g., by defining four different positions (cluster centers) within your one-dimensional dataset and assign each data point to the closest cluster center.

For validation purposes, we have added a validation set containing 1000 data points (validation_x) and their corresponding metastable state labels (validation_y).
