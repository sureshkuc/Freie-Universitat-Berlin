You are given CIFAR-type training data of 6000 images picturing either cats, dogs or frogs (see attached file). The data consists of training images (x_train) with associated labels (y_train) in {0=cat,1=dog, 2=frog} and an unlabeled test set (x_test). Your task is to train a neural network model to predict labels from images. As a submission, please upload your prediction of labels for the test set (x_test).

For the presentation, be prepared to show your code, explain how you prepared the data, how you chose the network architecture and other hyperparameters, how you validated the model, and show the convergence of the training error.
