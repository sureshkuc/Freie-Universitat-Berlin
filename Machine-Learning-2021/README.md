Project1: Implementation of a k-NN-Classifier
Implement a k-NN-Classifier in Python (incl. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib) on the Jupyter Notebook Environment. Use the “ZIP-Code”-Dataset1 with the training data as reference
for neighborhood. Evaluate the model on the test data.
(a) Print out the accuracy.
(b) Using Matplotlib, plot some of the numbers that are classified incorrectly.
(c) Which k is optimal for the accuracy?
(d) What are advantages and disadvantages for the k-NN-Classifier?

Project2: Implementation of a DBSCAN-Classifier
Implement a DBSCAN-Clustering in Python (incl. Numpy, Matplotlib) on the Jupyter Notebook Environment. Apply the algorithm on the “Two-Spirals”-dataset given in the notebook.
Evaluate the model on points given by that distribution.
(a) Use Mathplotlib to create a scatter plot highlighting the clusters that were found after
finding good hyperparameter values eps and minPts.
(b) Print accuracies for different data_size values.
(c) For what kind of data_size values does the algorithm fail and why? What would you
say are disadvantages of DBSCAN?
