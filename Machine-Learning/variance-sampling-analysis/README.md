# 📊 Variance Sampling Analysis

Welcome to the **Variance Sampling Analysis** project! 🎯  
This project demonstrates how different sampling techniques—**Simple Random Sampling** and **Stratified Sampling**—affect the **variance estimation** on different sample sizes using a real-world dataset.


---

## 🚀 Project Objective

The primary goal is to:
- Implement variance estimation using:
  - ✅ **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)** without replacement
  - ✅ **Stratified Sampling**
- Analyze and compare the variances across different sample sizes
- Visualize results for better understanding and interpretation

## 🧠 Techniques Used

* **Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement (SRSWOR)**
  Each sample has an equal probability of being chosen without replacement.

* **Stratified Sampling**
  The population is divided into strata (subgroups), and samples are taken from each stratum for more representative analysis.

## 🖼 Sample Outputs

Visualizations generated in the `outputs/` folder include:

| Technique  | Sample Size Variation        | Visualization                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| SRS        | Various n values             | ![ex4](outputs/ex4.png)      |
| Stratified | With proportional allocation | ![ex5\_1](outputs/ex5_1.png) |
| Comparison | Between techniques           | ![ex6](outputs/ex6.png)      |

## 🛠 Installation & Setup


### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Analysis

Run the main analysis script from the root directory:

```bash
python src/variance_sampling_analysis.py
```

The results will be printed to the console and saved in the `outputs/` folder.

---

## 📈 Results & Observations

* Stratified sampling generally yields **lower variance** when strata are well-defined.
* As the sample size increases, the variance decreases for both methods.
* Visualization plots highlight the **efficiency and stability** of each technique.
