Exercise 1. Implementation of a DBSCAN-Classifier
Implement a DBSCAN-Clustering in Python (incl. Numpy, Matplotlib) on the Jupyter Notebook Environment. Apply the algorithm on the “Two-Spirals”-dataset given in the notebook.
Evaluate the model on points given by that distribution.
(a) Use Mathplotlib to create a scatter plot highlighting the clusters that were found after
finding good hyperparameter values eps and minPts.
(b) Print accuracies for different data_size values.
(c) For what kind of data_size values does the algorithm fail and why? What would you
say are disadvantages of DBSCAN?
